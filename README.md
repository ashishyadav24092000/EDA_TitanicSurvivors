# EDA_TitanicSurvivors
In this repository we have performed Exploratory Data analysis to visualise and clean the data. After that we have build two models that is Logistic Regression model and XGBClassifier model to predict the survivors values. And at last we have computed the accuracy for both of our model and also the classifiaction report of the logistic Regression Algorithm.
